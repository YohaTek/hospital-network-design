# Hospital Network Design Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates a comprehensive network design for a hospital system with a headquarters and a branch office. The design implements a three-tier network architecture with various technologies to ensure redundancy, security, and efficient traffic management.

## Features
- 3-tier network architecture
- Network redundancy with HSRP
- Detailed IP subnetting plan
- VLAN implementation and inter-VLAN trunking
- OSPF single area routing
- IPsec VPN between HQ and Branch
- DHCP and Email server configuration
- NAT overload (PAT)
- ACL for security
- Switch port security
- Wireless APs with WPA2
- SSH for remote access
